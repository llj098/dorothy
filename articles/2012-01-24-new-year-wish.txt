Here comes 2012, and I wish all you guys have a happy year.  

I have some wishes for this year. I hope I can finish them.  

#### 1.Read a book every Two weeks/One month.  

   As I read more and more articles on the internet, I find that less and less content I satisfied with them.  
   I did not mean that there is little valuable on the web, I just mean that find the VERY excellent content is much easier by reading books rather than web. 

   I should also notes more thinsg when I read books. It can help me understand the book.  
   
#### 2.Shorten the sleep time to average 6-7 hours a day.

   I read some books about sleep 2 years ago[1]. After I left school, I found that time is more and more limited, and the life is more and more interesing, there are so many interesting things I should learn or do.  

   I tried several times to shorten my sleep time so I could get more time everyday. This training is 'funny', everyday you struggle on the bed and tell yourseft today is beautiful, you can do very very interesting things...  

   But until now, the result is not very good. I still need sleep more than 7 hours a day. So I should go on training. :)
   

#### 3.Send my immigration application.  

   You know this.  

#### 4.Write more codes.

   I need to write more codes, although last year is not bad, this year I need write more.  

   
--------------------

__And I wish all my friends:  __

You can have a happy year. You can have sweet dream every night. You can overcome your shortcoming(s). 

You can be a person who is more close to you want to be.
