I am preparing the immigration to Quebec province,Canada.  

I thought about immigration after graduate from university.I love china, but I don't like the goverment.  

When I just graduated from university, Computer science student is easy to immigrate to both Austrilia and Candada,it was two years ago.Due to I did not have any work experience then, I must wait.  

Two years later now, I have woring experience, but the Computer Science is not so hot now.It seems that there is only one choise for me : Quebec province of canada.  

The first language in Quebec is French,so I am learning french.  

I think french is harder than English,both the grammar and the pronounciation.And bad luck for us, we chose a bad scool: Kaiyu.  

They are liers and the teacher of us does not have enough teaching experience.They do not focus on the quality of the course but the speed.So we get very little and have some bad habit about our prononciation.  

Even worse that we have paid them 500 hours lessons fee. Refund is never allowed in this school.  

It is a long way to go. 

Bonne chance, tout le mond!
