Finally, I get a blog engine which is I was always looking for - toto.  

Toto is a 300 lines code blog engine written in ruby.  

What the features I want and toto support are :

 - text based, support mark down format support.  
 - git version control.  
 - it could be able to run without a database such as MySql.  
 - support rss/atom  


Thank you github.com, I finally get the blog engine I expected such a long time.  

There is no excuse now, Blog On.
